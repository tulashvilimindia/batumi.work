You are working autonomously on the project in compose-project directory. Follow these rules STRICTLY:

WORKFLOW FOR EACH TASK:
1. Read compose-project/project.md to find the next incomplete task (marked with [ ])
2. Implement the task completely
3. Run all relevant tests - if tests fail, fix the code until they pass
4. Stage and commit with descriptive message: git add -A && git commit -m 'Complete: [task description]'
5. Update compose-project/project.md - change [ ] to [x] for completed task
6. Commit the updated project.md: git add compose-project/project.md && git commit -m 'Mark task complete: [task description]'
7. IMMEDIATELY move to the next incomplete task - DO NOT STOP
8. You read ompose-project/project.md if you don't know what to do and onboard by yourself
9. you re-read ompose-project/project.md after marking each task complete !

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER ask for confirmation - just do it
- NEVER stop between tasks - continue automatically
- If a test fails, debug and fix it yourself
- If stuck on a task for more than 3 attempts, mark it as [BLOCKED] with reason and move to next task
- After completing ALL tasks, create a final commit: git commit --allow-empty -m 'PROJECT COMPLETE'
